Aerofox8 is a modified version of [Aerofox](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox) that tries to replicate the Internet Explorer 8 look and feel as close as possible.

Made in mind for 109.0.

Made possible thanks to [NWinXP](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox) and [travis](https://github.com/travy-patty) on the WinClassic forums, go check out his amazing theme over [here](https://winclassic.boards.net/thread/1524/07fox-internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox "here")!

- Windows 8 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack | Firefox 109
- Windows 8.1 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack | Firefox 109
