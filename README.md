Aerofox is a userchrome.css modification that (almost) pixel-perfectly replicates the look and feel of Internet Explorer version 8 (which shipped with Windows 7) on Firefox 108. (Untested on 109+, but it should work)

Based on and inspired by 07Fox, the work of [travis](https://github.com/travy-patty) on the WinClassic forums, go check out his amazing theme over [here](https://winclassic.boards.net/thread/1524/07fox-internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox "here")!

## Supported operating systems
While you may be able to use the theme on macOS, Linux, and BSD, it will not function as intended. This theme was coded ONLY for the built-in Aero style under Windows Vista, 7, and 8.x. Other themes or operating systems may cause the theme not to display as intended.  
**Windows 10 is untested and may not be compatible.  
No support is planned for Windows 10 and 11.**

**Tested on:**  
- Windows Vista SP2 x64 (with Extended Kernel by win32)  
- Windows 7 SP1 x64  
- Windows 8.0 x64  
- Windows 8.0 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack  
- Windows 8.1 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack  
- Windows 8.1 x64

## FAQ
- **Why would anyone want to make/use this? What is wrong with you?**  
I made this for fun, to see how similar I could make Firefox look like an old version of Internet Explorer. 
Additionally, I prefer the aesthetics of Internet Explorer 8 and Windows Aero over current design trends.
- **How do I install it?**  
Read [installation.md](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox/blob/main/installation.md "installation.md") for detailed installation instructions.
- **How did you change the Firefox branding? How can I get navigation sounds and other miscellaneous tweaks?**  
Read [extras.md](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox/blob/main/extras.md "extras.md") for some extra tweaks and cool stuff, and instructions on how to edit the contents of omni.ja's strings.
-**Can I modify it?**  
You are free to do whatever you want with this theme, it's freely available after all!
