AerofoxSomewhatExtras is a subset of extras made by me (ImSwordKing) that modifies firefox to include some modifications extra modifications not included in the OG theme.

Made in mind for 109.0. Somewhat works on 110.

Made possible thanks to [NWinXP](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox) and [travis](https://github.com/travy-patty) on the WinClassic forums, go check out his amazing theme over [here](https://winclassic.boards.net/thread/1524/07fox-internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox "here")!

**Tested on:**  
- Windows Vista SP2 x64 (with Extended Kernel by win32) | Firefox 109 | Firefox 110 (Theme might look wrong in certain parts)
- Windows 8.1 x64 with Aero Glass DWM hack | Firefox 109 | Firefox 110 (Theme might look wrong in certain parts)
