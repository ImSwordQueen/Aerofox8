# Installation Instructions
## ⚠️WARNING⚠️
This mod requires editing firefox omni.ja files which gets replaced with each update. You have to disable updates to keep the modifications.
This could break at any time in new versions above 109.0. I will take no responsability if it breaks above version 109. 

## Extracting Omni.ja
Firefox uses not only 1 omni.ja but 2. And both aren't interchangable so make sure you are modifying the right one. one is found in the root folder and the other in browser.
Use 7-ZIP to extract and then compress the files.

## Setting up
Copy the folders in this repository in the correct omni.ja. It is that simple.

~~**This most likely will become obsolete when NWinXP releases their [Extras](https://github.com/NWinXP/Aerofox/blob/main/extras.md) page. I suggest using that when it comes out.**~~ This didn't age well....
